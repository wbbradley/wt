## GitHub authored-PR discovery and remote identity cache

- Extend `RepositoryConfig` with a backward-compatible derived map from every Git remote name to canonical `(host, owner, repository)` identities, plus the preferred remote. Refresh this cache opportunistically; warn rather than silently rewriting conflicting identities.
- Infer configured GitHub hosts from every tracked remote and union them with explicit hosts and `github.com`.
- Extend `src/github.rs` to discover, per configured/inferred host, the authenticated viewer and all open PRs authored by that viewer only—include drafts, exclude review-requested and merely team-authored PRs. Paginate in the background through GitHub Search's practical 1,000-result ceiling, surface truncation and later-page warnings, and coalesce this work with startup, manual, scheduled, and post-mutation GitHub refreshes.
- Render local worktrees immediately and publish authored-PR pages progressively. Keep the last fully successful authored-PR snapshot while loading or after any page/host failure; only remove disappeared PRs after a complete successful refresh. Preserve existing rate-limit suppression, classified errors, direct HTTP/token handling, and stale-data semantics.
- Canonically identify a PR as `(host, base owner/repository, PR number)`. Suppress it only when GitHub associated-PR data ties an active local worktree to that identity; group fork PRs under their base repository.
- Map against every GitHub remote: prefer configured `github_remote`, then `origin`, then catalog order; display once, and treat missing/invalid catalog paths as unmapped.
- Cover viewer filtering, pagination/truncation, Enterprise hosts, progressive/stale snapshots, canonical suppression, all-remotes mapping, duplicate preference, and fork/base grouping.

## Virtual authored-PR repository and row models

- Extend `src/app.rs`, `src/ui.rs`, and `src/tui.rs` with stable canonical IDs and explicit virtual-repository/virtual-PR models.
- Preserve selection and expansion as pages arrive or refresh reorder occurs; on completed removal, select the repository header or nearest row.
- Preserve catalog order for mapped repositories; append unmapped base repositories sorted by `owner/repository`; sort their virtual PRs by newest `updated_at`.
- Label groups `owner/repository`; show a grey `[no local repo]` marker for unusable repositories.
- Render `#<number> <head-branch> — <title> [virtual] [checks]`; show complete base/head/SHA/draft/check/review/URL detail and `Enter to create worktree`.
- Filter on repository, branch, PR number, title, and author. Disable every palette/direct action on virtual rows with a reason; Enter is the sole materialization gesture with no confirmation.
- Cover stable selection/order/filtering, progressive updates, `[no local repo]`, detail rendering, and action disabling.

## Safe repository bootstrap for virtual PRs

- Re-fetch selected PR metadata and head SHA. Allow checkout after close/merge while displaying state; abort only when the PR/repository is gone or inaccessible.
- Reuse a usable mapped repository. Otherwise resolve `repository_root` and try `<repo>.git`, `<owner>-<repo>.git`, then `<host>-<owner>-<repo>.git`, reusing only canonical identity matches and never adopting, overwriting, or deleting unrelated paths.
- Clone the base as a bare partial clone with `--filter=blob:none`, falling back to normal bare clone when unsupported.
- Prefer SSH, then authenticated noninteractive HTTPS without exposing tokens in arguments, logs, progress, or errors; disable Git/SSH prompts.
- Register the validated bare repository with a unique label. When relinking a stale matching entry, preserve label, `worktree_root`, and preferred remote and never touch the stale path.
- Keep validated/registered repositories after later failures; clean only clearly marked incomplete clone artifacts.
- Cover name collisions, stale relinking, partial-clone fallback, transport credential safety, and failure-stage retention/cleanup.

## Safe PR branch and linked-worktree materialization

- If a local remote represents the head repository, fetch and track the real head branch, including forks. Otherwise fetch GitHub's PR head ref into `pr/<number>-<sanitized-head-branch>` without permanently adding the fork remote.
- Record canonical PR identity in branch-local Git config. Fast-forward an unattached intended branch only when safe; preserve ahead/diverged/other-PR branches and choose a disambiguated name. Never discard local commits or reset solely because of a PR marker.
- Create through shared operation helpers: use `<worktree_root>/<sanitized-local-branch>` when configured, otherwise `<repository_root>/<repo>-pr-<number>`. Fail if the destination belongs to something else; never add numeric path suffixes.
- Refresh success into an ordinary row and return its canonical path through the existing stdout/Bash `chdir` protocol.
- Cover real versus synthetic branches, divergence preservation, PR markers, destination rules, and exact shell selection.

## Background materialization, cancellation, and documentation

- Run lock wait, clone, fetch, branch, and worktree creation in a background worker with cancellable progress states. `Ctrl-c` must terminate the active Git child, clean only owned incomplete artifacts, retain completed safe stages, leave the shell directory unchanged, and restore the TUI.
- Hold the catalog sidecar lock from bootstrap through registration and worktree creation and show `waiting for catalog lock` while retrying.
- Do not auto-remove bootstrapped repositories/worktrees when PRs close. Do not make direct selectors such as `wt owner/repo:#123` materialize PRs.
- Update `README.md` with authored-PR discovery, host configuration, virtual rows, root expansion, bootstrap naming/transport, locking, branch safety, persistence, and cancellation.
- Cover child cancellation and failure cleanup, then run formatting, lint, the full test suite, and Bash syntax checks.

Complete the authored-PR feature when every open authored PR appears once under its base repository, Enter safely creates or reuses a persistent repository and ordinary linked worktree, unmapped repositories bootstrap under the configured root without destructive behavior, and all project checks pass.
