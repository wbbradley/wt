## Bash navigation, selectors, and completion

Complete shell-facing navigation and local-only discovery ergonomics.

- Add `shell/wt.bash` with a Bash 3.2-compatible `wt` function: navigation captures `command wt` stdout and calls `builtin cd -- "$destination"` only after successful nonempty selection; catalog/worktree/help/version commands pass through unchanged.
- Ensure accepted selections always navigate to the worktree root and that cancellation/failure leaves PWD unchanged, including paths containing spaces.
- Add `wt <repo-label>:<branch-or-worktree>` unique resolution by branch/basename/path, opening the TUI prefiltered when ambiguous rather than guessing.
- Add Bash 3.2-compatible completion for flags, subcommands, labels, qualified selectors, branches, and paths through a local-only endpoint that preserves spaces, avoids GitHub, and never opens the TUI.
- Shell-test navigation, exact roots, spaces, cancellation/failure preservation, passthrough, selectors, ambiguity handling, and completion.

## Documentation, integration hardening, and completion audit

Finish product documentation and verify the complete normal/bare/global workflow end to end.

- Document installation, registration, unregistered-session onboarding, bare repositories, CRUD safety and confirmations, keys/action palette, shell setup/completion, selectors, config, GitHub/GHE authentication, rate/error behavior, and troubleshooting in `README.md`.
- Verify repository-level error isolation, progressive local/GitHub rendering, action confirmations, selection output, and terminal cleanup across integrated flows.
- Ensure `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test` pass.
- Manually verify normal and bare workflows, progressive GitHub updates, CRUD confirmations and safeguards, terminal restoration, cancellation/failure behavior, and sourced Bash navigation.
- Audit every requirement preserved across the preceding phases and add/fix any missing coverage before declaring the product complete.
